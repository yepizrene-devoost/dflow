## 🚀 About

**dflow** is a lightweight CLI tool that brings structure, consistency, and adaptability to Git branching workflows. Inspired by [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), it simplifies modern development practices with:

- Minimal setup and easy onboarding
- Opinionated branching strategies with flexibility
- Support for environments with or without pull requests

Whether you're working solo or in a team, `dflow` helps you keep your Git history clean and your process repeatable.

---

## 📦 Installation

### 🧪 Option 1: Precompiled Binaries (Recommended)

Download the latest binary for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/yepizrene-devoost/dflow/releases).

#### Linux (x86_64)
```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/yepizrene-devoost/dflow/releases/latest/download/dflow_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
tar -xzf dflow_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
sudo mv dflow /usr/local/bin/
```

#### macOS (Apple Silicon)

curl -LO https://github.com/yepizrene-devoost/dflow/releases/latest/download/dflow_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz
tar -xzf dflow_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz
sudo mv dflow /usr/local/bin/
```

#### Windows (x86_64)

1. Download: [dflow_Windows_x86_64.zip](https://github.com/yepizrene-devoost/dflow/releases/latest/download/dflow_Windows_x86_64.zip)  
2. Extract and add the folder to your system PATH manually.

> 💡 Make sure `/usr/local/bin` (or equivalent) is in your `$PATH`.

---

### 🛠 Option 2: Build from Source

Requires [Go 1.21+](https://golang.org/doc/install):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yepizrene-devoost/dflow.git
cd dflow
go install
```

---

## 🛠️ Commands

### `dflow init`

Interactive setup for your repository.

```bash
dflow init
```

- Select base branches (`main`, `develop`, etc.)
- Define prefixes for `feature`, `release`, `hotfix`
- Choose merge behavior (auto vs manual/PR)
- Creates a `.dflow.yaml` config file

---

### `dflow start <type> <name>`

Start a new branch based on your workflow config.

```bash
dflow start feat login-form
dflow start release v1.2.0
dflow start hotfix urgent-patch
```

- Validates base branches
- Auto-generates branch names like `feat/login-form`
- Creates the branch and checks it out

---

### `dflow config`

Manage user-level configuration.

```bash
dflow config author "Author Name" --email authoremail@domain.com
```

- Stores global author info used in changelogs
- Respects `.gitconfig` or local overrides

---

## 🔧 Configuration

`dflow` uses a `.dflow.yaml` file stored at the root of your repository. It is auto-generated by `dflow init` and looks like this:

```yaml
#
#               ██████╗ ███████╗██╗      ██████╗ ██╗    ██╗
#               ██╔══██╗██╔════╝██║     ██╔═══██╗██║    ██║
#               ██║  ██║█████╗  ██║     ██║   ██║██║ █╗ ██║
#               ██║  ██║██╔══╝  ██║     ██║   ██║██║███╗██║
#               ██████╔╝██║     ███████╗╚██████╔╝╚███╔███╔╝
#               ╚═════╝ ╚═╝     ╚══════╝ ╚═════╝  ╚══╝╚══╝ 

#            dflow config file - autogenerated by 'dflow init'

branches:
  main: main
  develop: develop
  uat: develop
  features: feature/
  releases: release/
  hotfixes: hotfix/

flow:
  feature_base: develop
  feature_merge: develop
  release_base: develop
  hotfix_base: main

workflow:
  default_merge_mode: auto
  branch_rules: {}
```

---

## 🧪 Example Workflow

```bash
dflow init
# Select main = main, develop = develop

dflow start feat login-form
# ⇒ Creates and switches to feat/login-form

# work and commit...

# manually merge feat/login-form to develop (auto or PR) based on printed instructions
```

---

## ⏳ Coming Soon

### `dflow finish`

This command will automate the merge and changelog process for `feature`, `release`, and `hotfix` branches based on your merge mode configuration.

For now, `dflow` prints manual instructions depending on your workflow setup.

> 💡 This is currently a *manual* step. Use the printed guide or your team's PR flow until this command is fully available.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Interactive `init` wizard
- ✅ Customizable prefixes and merge rules
- ✅ Support for hybrid workflows (direct merge + PR)
- ✅ Git-aware config and validation
- ⏳ `dflow finish` improvements in progress
- 📦 Multiplatform builds (via `GoReleaser`)
- 🌐 Multi-language documentation (`README.md`, `README.es.md`)
