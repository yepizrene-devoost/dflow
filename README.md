## 🚀 About

**dflow** is a lightweight CLI tool that brings structure, consistency, and adaptability to Git branching workflows. Inspired by [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), it simplifies modern development practices with:

- Minimal setup and easy onboarding
- Opinionated branching strategies with flexibility
- Support for environments with or without pull requests

Whether you're working solo or in a team, `dflow` helps you keep your Git history clean and your process repeatable.

---

```


> 💡 Rename the binary to `dflow` and ensure `/usr/local/bin` is in your `$PATH`.

---

### 🛠 Option 2: Build from Source (for contributors)

Requires [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.21+ installed:

```bash
go install github.com/yepizrene-devoost/dflow@latest
```

---

## 🛠️ Commands

### `dflow init`

Interactive setup for your repository.

```bash
dflow init
```

- Select base branches (`main`, `develop`, etc.)
- Define prefixes for `feature`, `release`, `hotfix`
- Choose merge behavior (auto vs manual/PR)
- Creates a `.dflow.yaml` config file

---

### `dflow start <type> <name>`

Start a new branch based on your workflow config.

```bash
dflow start feat login-form
dflow start release v1.2.0
dflow start hotfix urgent-patch
```

- Validates base branches
- Auto-generates branch names like `feat/login-form`
- Creates the branch and checks it out

---

### `dflow config`

Manage user-level configuration.

```bash
dflow config author "Rene Yepiz" --email rene@devoost.com
```

- Stores global author info used in changelogs
- Respects `.gitconfig` or local overrides

---

## 🔧 Configuration

`dflow` uses a `.dflow.yaml` file stored at the root of your repository. It is auto-generated by `dflow init` and looks like this:

```yaml
#              ██████╗ ███████╗██╗   ██╗ ██████╗  ██████╗ ███████╗████████╗
#              ██╔══██╗██╔════╝██║   ██║██╔═══██╗██╔═══██╗██╔════╝╚══██╔══╝
#              ██║  ██║█████╗  ██║   ██║██║   ██║██║   ██║███████╗   ██║   
#              ██║  ██║██╔══╝  ╚██╗ ██╔╝██║   ██║██║   ██║╚════██║   ██║   
#              ██████╔╝███████╗ ╚████╔╝ ╚██████╔╝╚██████╔╝███████║   ██║   
#              ╚═════╝ ╚══════╝  ╚═══╝   ╚═════╝  ╚═════╝ ╚══════╝   ╚═╝   

#                 dflow config file - autogenerated by 'dflow init'

branches:
  main: main
  develop: develop
  uat: develop
  features: feature/
  releases: release/
  hotfixes: hotfix/

flow:
  feature_base: develop
  feature_merge: develop
  release_base: develop
  hotfix_base: main

workflow:
  default_merge_mode: auto
  branch_rules: {}
```

### How it works

- **`branches`**: maps standard names (`main`, `develop`, `uat`) and prefixes for each branch type.
- **`flow`**: defines where each type of branch starts from and where it should be merged.
- **`workflow`**:
  - `default_merge_mode`: can be `auto` (merge automatically) or `manual` (prompt for PR).
  - `branch_rules`: (optional) lets you override merge mode per target branch.

---

## 🧪 Example Workflow

```bash
dflow init
# Select main = main, develop = develop

dflow start feat login-form
# ⇒ Creates and switches to feat/login-form

# work and commit...

# manually merge feat/login-form to develop (auto or PR) based on printed instructions
```

---

## ⏳ Coming Soon

### `dflow finish`

This command will automate the merge and changelog process for `feature`, `release`, and `hotfix` branches based on your merge mode configuration.

For now, `dflow` prints manual instructions depending on your workflow setup.

> 💡 This is currently a *manual* step. Use the printed guide or your team's PR flow until this command is fully available.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Interactive `init` wizard
- ✅ Customizable prefixes and merge rules
- ✅ Support for hybrid workflows (direct merge + PR)
- ✅ Git-aware config and validation
- ⏳ `dflow finish` improvements in progress
- 📦 Multiplatform builds (via `Makefile`)
- 🌐 Multi-language documentation (`README.md`, `README.es.md`)
